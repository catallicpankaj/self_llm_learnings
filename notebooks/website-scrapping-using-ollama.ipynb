    "\n",
    "This notebook tells us how to scrape the text content from a website using Python (we will use a existing library here), then summarize that content using OpenAI's GPT model. It covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Importing required libraries for web requests, HTML parsing, environment management, and OpenAI API access.\n",
    "- Loading the OpenAI API key from environment variables.\n",
    "- Defining a class to fetch and extract text from a given website URL.\n",
    "- Displaying the scraped text in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- Sending the website content to an OpenAI GPT model with a custom prompt to generate a concise, markdown-formatted summary.\n",
    "- Displaying the generated summary in the notebook.\n",
    "- The workflow is: scrape → display raw text → summarize with LLM → display summary.\n",
    "- As an example I will use my own tech blogs website - https://pankajtechblogs.dev/ - please feel free to visit if not done yet. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "*As first step - let's import the necessary Python libraries and packages that will assist us throughout our code.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Brief summary of what we gonna use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **os:** Provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as reading environment variables or file paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **requests:** Allows you to send HTTP requests easily, useful for fetching data from web APIs or websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **dotenv.load_dotenv:** Loads environment variables from a .env file into your environment, often used for managing secrets like API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **bs4.BeautifulSoup:** Parses and extracts data from HTML or XML documents, commonly used for web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IPython.display.display, Markdown:** Lets you display rich content (like formatted Markdown) directly in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **openai.OpenAI:** Provides access to the OpenAI API, enabling you to interact with models like GPT for tasks such as text generation or summarization.\n"
