    "Imported required libraries for web scraping, environment management, and OpenAI API access.\n",
    "Loaded the OpenAI API key from environment variables and initialized the OpenAI client with the GPT-4o-mini model.\n",
    "Defined a Website class to scrape a given URL, extract the main text content (excluding scripts, styles, images, and input tags), and collect all links from the page.\n",
    "Instantiated the Website class for a sample website and extracted its links.\n",
    "Created a system prompt for the LLM to help identify which links are relevant for a company brochure (e.g., About, Careers).\n",
    "Defined a user prompt function to format the list of links for the LLM and ask it to select the most relevant ones.\n",
    "Implemented a function to call the LLM (using OpenAI’s API) to analyze the links and return a JSON object with only the brochure-relevant links.\n",

    "The notebook sets up web scraping for a company website, gathers all links, and uses an LLM to intelligently filter and select the most relevant links for inclusion in a company brochure."
