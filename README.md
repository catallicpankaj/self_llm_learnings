# Self LLM Learnings - DRAFT Version - Motive is as mentioned below.

Welcome to the **Self LLM Learnings** repository! This project is a personal collection of notes, code, and experiments focused on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI). The goal is to document my journey in understanding, building, and applying LLMs using open-source tools and frameworks.

## About

This repository contains:
- Hands-on experiments with LLMs and GenAI models
- Code snippets and scripts for training, fine-tuning, and inference
- Notes and resources for understanding LLM architectures and applications
- Examples using popular libraries like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, and more
